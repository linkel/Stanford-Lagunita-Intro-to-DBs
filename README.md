# Stanford-Lagunita-Intro-to-DBs

I meandered my way through the relational algebra and had a good time. The quizzes were easy but I found the last few challenge problems very difficult--the renaming syntax was a bit confusing, and I was not used to thinking about diff'ing sets to properly exclude rows (looking at you, the pizzerias who serve pizzas only eaten by over 30 folks query). 

Overall it was a good intro but I get the sense I need a lot more practice with this. I was hoping that through this course I'd improve at writing complicated stored procedures at work, but that's not really the domain of this course--however, I did get exposed to some concepts that will likely be good for me to polish in the future (better understanding of sets and set operators, vague exposure to first order logic). 

# What I wrote back in April

Introduction to databases, a Stanford Lagunita course composed of 14 mini-courses. 

I was curious about this course. I wanted to know a bit more about the fundamentals behind SQL, relational algebra, and this seemed like a nice option to get acquainted.
